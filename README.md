# Doctor Ratings Example Project

This is an example of a .Net Core Client/Server using Angular, EF, LINQ and SQLite.

## Quick Start

```
Please just copy all files into an empty folder and 
open the 'DoctorRatings.sln' file in Visual Studio 2017 or newer.

* Rebuild the entire solution.
* Launch the 'DoctorRatingsServer' project first.
* Launch the 'DoctorRatingsClient' project second.
```

### Dependencies

Please ensure your have an up-to-date dev environment...

* .NET Core 2.2

* Latest Chrome Browser.

All the required NuGet and NPM packages will be installed by selecting "Rebuild Solution" from inside Visual Studio.

### Launching

* The solution contains two C# projects, one for the "client" and one for the "server".

Please make sure the Server is running first so the Client can load data from it.

Please use Chrome as your preferred browser.

## Assumptions

** Conformance to the spec provided seemed "part of the test".

* No unit tests were mentioned, so none exist.
* No security was mentioned, so CORS is wide open to allow client/server communication on local dev.
* No logging was mentioned, so none other than built-in exists.
* Time is of the essence, so formatting/comments are lacking.
* If I don't finish this and send it to you, nobody will known it even exists.

## Conclusions

* Thank You!

Of all the "interview strategies" I have been a part of, "Just show me your code!" has always been my favorite. :)
